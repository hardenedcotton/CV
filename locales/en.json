    "title": "ABOUT ME",
    "content": "I was born and raised in İzmir, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by electronics and computers. My curiosity started with a simple question to my parents: Where do all the deleted files go? That curiosity quickly turned into a passion for understanding how things work, often by taking them apart to see what’s the engineering like inside.<br>Over the years, this drive led me to programming and engineering, where I find joy in building things from scratch and experimenting with new ideas. I enjoy working on hobby projects and constantly seek opportunities to learn and refine my skills. My passion for design also plays a big role in my creative process; I spend much of my free time in software like Photoshop and Blender, exploring both technical and artistic aspects of digital creation.<br>Beyond technology, I am a dedicated motorsports fan, always intrigued by the engineering brilliance behind racing. Whether it's programming, design, or engineering, I thrive on innovation, problem-solving, and pushing boundaries."
